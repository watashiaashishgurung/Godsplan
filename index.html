    <h1>The legend of arceus</h1>
    <div id="story">
        <p>Heero and Kyle stood at the edge of a sprawling hillside, the land stretching out beneath them in a vast, undulating tapestry of greens and golds. The horizon melted seamlessly into the sky, where clouds drifted lazily, their edges softening as they kissed the distant treetops. The sun was dipping low, casting a warm, golden hue across the landscape and setting the stage for a profound conversation.
            As they surveyed the breathtaking view, Heero broke the serene silence..</p>
        <p>Heero: “Kyle do you believe in God?”</p>
        <p>Kyle: “Don’t know, I never really thought about God”</p>
        <p>Heero: “Do you think God exist?”</p>
        <p>Kyle: “Maybe”</p>
        <p>Heero: “Well I met someone, she told me she never knew her parents.”</p>
        <p>“She’s an orphan and she was adopted when she was a baby.”</p>
        <p>“For her, her parents gave her life, and left her.”</p>
        <p>“They only exist in her imagination, just like God. She can’t even imagine their faces and she has no memory of them.”</p>
        <p>“But they do exist, just like God.”</p>
        <p>“Do you think God exists for people like her?”</p>
        <p>Kyle: “I guess so.. yes”</p>
        <p>Heero: “Well one day we all will be old, and we all become orphans, do you think God will be there for us too?”</p>
        <p>Kyle: “.. well if you put it that way.., yes”</p>
        <p>Heero: “I think God is like a parent, we are all his children, and he will be there for us when we are old.”</p>
