        <p>Heero: “Kyle do you believe in God?”</p>
        <p>Kyle: “Don’t know, I never really thought about God”</p>
        <p>Heero: “Do you think God exist?”</p>
        <p>Kyle: “Maybe”</p>
        <p>Heero: “Well I met someone, she told me she never knew her parents.”</p>
        <p>“She’s an orphan and she was adopted when she was a baby.”</p>
        <p>“For her, her parents gave her life, and left her.”</p>
        <p>“They only exist in her imagination, just like God. She can’t even imagine their faces and she has no memory of them.”</p>
        <p>“But they do exist, just like God.”</p>
        <p>“Do you think God exists for people like her?”</p>
        <p>Kyle: “I guess so.. yes”</p>
        <p>Heero: “Well one day we all will be old, and we all become orphans, do you think God will be there for us too?”</p>
        <p>Kyle: “.. well if you put it that way.., yes”</p>
        <p>Heero: “I think God is like a parent, we are all his children, and he will be there for us when we are old.”</p>
