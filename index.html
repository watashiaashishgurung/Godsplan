In the darkest of night, it’s the moon that guides us and enlightens us with insights we never ever would have been able to imagine.<br>

Heero:”Kyle do you believe in God?”<br>
Kyle:”Don’t know, I never really thought about God”<br>
Heero:”Do you think God exist?”<br>
Kyle:”Maybe”<br>

Heero:”Well I met someone, she told me she never know her parents.” <br>“She’s an orphan and she was adopted when she was a baby” 
<br>“For her parents, gave her life, and left her.” “They only exist in her imagination,<br>
 just like God. She can’t even imagine their faces and she has no memory of them”<br> 
“But they do exists, just like God”<br>

“Do you think God exists for people like her?<br>

Kyle:”I guess so..” “yes”<br>

Heero: “Well one day we all will be old, and we all become orphans, do you think God will be there for us too?”<br>

Kyle:”..” "well if you put it that way.., yes"<br>
